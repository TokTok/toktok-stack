# TokTok stack

## Downloading

To download the TokTok stack, use `git`:

```sh
$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/TokTok/toktok-stack
```

## Building

After installing prerequisites (instructions below), run the following command
in the `toktok-stack` directory:

```sh
$ bazel build //...
```

### Installing prerequisites

To build the stack, first you need to install some software. This guide
assumes an installation of Debian GNU/Linux version 9 and that you are in the
`toktok-stack` directory. There is partial support for Mac OS X and FreeBSD,
but not all targets can be built on those systems.

#### Bazel

Install the latest version of
[Bazel](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/releases), e.g.:

```sh
$ wget https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/releases/download/0.16.0/bazel_0.16.0-linux-x86_64.deb
$ sudo dpkg -i bazel_0.16.0-linux-x86_64.deb
```

#### Maven

If you want to build Java binaries, you need to install Maven:

```sh
$ sudo apt install maven
```

#### Android SDK

If you want to build Android apps such as `toktok-android`, you need the
[Android SDK](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html). E.g.:

```sh
$ wget https://dl.google.com/android/repository/sdk-tools-linux-3859397.zip
$ unzip -d third_party/android/sdk/ sdk-tools-linux-3859397.zip
$ rm sdk-tools-linux-3859397.zip
```

You will need to install the latest build tools (`aapt` and friends) and
platform 27 (targetted by our Android apps) using the SDK manager. Press "y"
to accept all the licenses as you are asked. Use `sdkmanager --list` to see
the latest versions of each package after updating.

```sh
$ third_party/android/sdk/tools/bin/sdkmanager --update
$ third_party/android/sdk/tools/bin/sdkmanager 'build-tools;27.0.3'
$ third_party/android/sdk/tools/bin/sdkmanager 'platforms;android-27'
```

#### Qt5

To build Qt-based binaries such as `qtox`, you need an installation of Qt
development headers and libraries and tools.

```sh
$ sudo apt install qttools5-dev libqt5svg5-dev
```

The build expects symlinks to the development files in `third_party/qt`:

```sh
$ ln -s /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/qt5/bin third_party/qt/bin
$ ln -s /usr/include/x86_64-linux-gnu/qt5 third_party/qt/include
$ ln -s /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu third_party/qt/lib
```

You may need slightly different paths depending on where your Qt installation
lives.

#### Python

To build `py-toxcore-c` and other programs using Python FFI, you need Python
development headers. `py-toxcore-c` currently builds for Python 2 in the Bazel
build, while `toxic` needs Python 3.

```sh
$ sudo apt install python2.7-dev python3.5-dev
```

#### Make

For `//js-toxcore-c`, you will need a `make` program in your `$PATH`:

```sh
$ sudo apt install make
```

#### Mercurial

For `//qtox/osx/updater`, you will need the `hg` program in your `$PATH`,
because it contains a Go program that points at a Bitbucket Mercurial
repository:

```sh
$ sudo apt install mercurial
```

#### Native javacpp libraries

Streambot needs native libraries that need to be downloaded from Maven.

```sh
$ wget http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/bytedeco/javacpp-presets/ffmpeg/3.4.1-1.4/ffmpeg-3.4.1-1.4-linux-x86_64.jar -O third_party/javacpp/ffmpeg/jar/ffmpeg-3.4.1-1.4-linux-x86_64.jar
$ wget http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/bytedeco/javacpp-presets/opencv/3.4.0-1.4/opencv-3.4.0-1.4-linux-x86_64.jar -O third_party/javacpp/opencv/jar/opencv-3.4.0-1.4-linux-x86_64.jar
```

#### Extra development packages

Some libraries have not yet been imported into `third_party`, so must be
installed on the system.

For `//qtox`:
```sh
$ sudo apt install libopenal-dev libsqlite3-dev libasound2-dev libxss-dev
```

For `//toxic`:
```sh
$ sudo apt install libopenal-dev libncurses5-dev libxss-dev
```

Note that toxic also needs Python 3. See the section on Python for how to
install its development files.

For `//c-toxcore/testing:av_test`:
```sh
$ sudo apt install libcv-dev libhighgui-dev
```

## Building native code for Android

After installing prerequisites (instructions below), run:

```sh
$ bazel build \
    //c-toxcore/auto_tests/... \
    --crosstool_top=//external:android/crosstool \
    --cpu=armeabi-v7a \
    --host_crosstool_top=@bazel_tools//tools/cpp:toolchain \
    --verbose_failures
```

WARNING: This build mode does not work at all, yet. Patches welcome!

### Installing prerequisites

#### NDK

```sh
$ wget https://dl.google.com/android/repository/android-ndk-r14b-linux-x86_64.zip
$ unzip android-ndk-r14b-linux-x86_64.zip -d third_party/android
```
