# Copy this file to .bazelrc.local and adjust to meet your needs.

# You may choose one of the possible sandboxing technologies.
#build --config=sandboxfs
#build --config=docker-sandbox

# Optionally enable *one* of the following configs. If none is enabled, we build
# in fastbuild mode (no optimisation, minimal debugging information).
#build --config=debug
#build --config=release

# You may use the remote cache. This is mostly only useful when building with
# docker-sandbox, as that way you'll be sharing build artifacts with the CI
# builds, speeding up your builds significantly.
#build --config=remote

# Pick *one* of these for the target platform. "nix" is the default Linux target.
#
# remote-exec will also cache, so no need for remote in that case.
build --config=nix
#build --config=remote-exec
#build --config=local

# You may also pick a cross-compile target, which should be combined with one
# of the above (needed to have a host toolchain available).
